# Custom Video Player

This is an exercise in dynamically rendering a video and programming custom controls. This example made in javascript upon clicking the "Show the video" button dynamically imports html elements displaying the video that can be controlled by custom controlls. The user is given the ability to pause, play and set current time of the video.
